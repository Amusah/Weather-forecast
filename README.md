# A weather forecast application

## Welcome
Thanks for checking out the project.

The app was design using OOP paradign.

the project's design was inspired by [Uizard](https://uizard.io/templates/web-app-templates/weather-web-app-light/)

*The application is powered by the following services:*
- [Geocode](geocode.xyz) API, which was used to get current location on page load through [reverse geocoding](https://geocode.xyz/api)

- [Weather](https://www.weatherapi.com/) API, which is used to render current weather condition.

- [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/) API, which is used to render 7-day forcast.

*click on this [link](https://weather-forecast-mocha.vercel.app/) to preview this app live*

or download and extract the zip file onto your local machine,
open with [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your prefered text.

pull up your terminal, navigate into the project's directory and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
Finally open with live server to preview it locally.

>[!NOTE]
> As a result of limited access to API resources, I was unable to implement all features as listed on the nav bar.
