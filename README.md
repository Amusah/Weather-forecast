*The application is powered by the following services:*
- [Geocode](geocode.xyz) API, which was used to get current location on page load through [reverse geocoding](https://geocode.xyz/api)

- [Weather](https://www.weatherapi.com/) API, which was used to render current weather condition.

- [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/) API, which was used to render 7-day forcast.
